My name is Ilan Eskinazi. I'm an engineer, a scientist, and a software developer.

### My story

In the past I've worked on magnetic self-assembly, electrodynamic zero net-mass-flux actuators, modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems, and even a bit of robotics. Now I'm a data scientist interested in predictive models and artificial intelligence.
